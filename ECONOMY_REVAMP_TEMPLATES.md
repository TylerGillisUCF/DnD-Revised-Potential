## GAMBLER ENCOUNTER (Revised - Safer Betting)

```
# RANDOM ENCOUNTER: GAMBLER
====================================================================================================
====================================================================================================
### THE GAMBLER'S GAME
**FOCUS: DEXTERITY & LUCK | COIN EARNING OPPORTUNITY**

**(After Cameo 9 - Players likely have 25-35 coins)**

---

**DM NARRATION:**
"You arrive at a run-down tavern called 'The Broken Coin.' Inside, rough-looking patrons eye you warily.

In the back corner, a slick gambler in a worn velvet coat shuffles three cards with lightning speed. A pile of coins sits beside him—he's been winning, but not too much.

He grins, gold tooth glinting. 'Step right up, friend! Test your luck and skill! Find the Queen of Hearts!'"

---

### **HOW THE GAME WORKS (Safer Betting)**

**ROUND 1 - THE INTRODUCTION (Low Risk)**
- **Cost to play:** 2 coins
- **Prize if you win:** 7 coins (net profit: +5 coins)
- **What you need:** Roll DEX + d20, need 10+ to track the card

The gambler shuffles three cards (Queen of Hearts, King of Spades, King of Clubs) and you must track the Queen.

[DM: Actually shuffle three cards for the player to watch]

**Player chooses a card, then rolls DEX + d20:**
- **10+ and correct card:** You win! +7 coins (net +5 coins profit)
  - Gambler: "Nicely done! Want to try for bigger stakes? Or walk away with your winnings?"

- **10+ but wrong card:** You tracked well but chose wrong. Lose 2 coins, but the gambler is impressed: "Close! Want another shot? Same price."

- **9 or less:** You couldn't track the card. Lose 2 coins. "Better luck next time, friend!"

---

### **ROUND 2 - DOUBLE STAKES (Medium Risk) - Optional**

If you won Round 1, the gambler offers: "Feeling lucky? Double the stakes! 4 coins to play, win 12 coins!"

- **Cost:** 4 coins
- **Prize:** 12 coins (net profit: +8 coins)
- **What you need:** Roll DEX + d20, need 12+

**Results:**
- **12+:** You win 12 coins! Total profit so far: +13 coins from both rounds!
  - Gambler: "TWO in a row?! Impressive! One more round? This is where it gets REALLY interesting..."

- **Fail:** You lose 4 coins, but keep your winnings from Round 1 (net total: +1 coin overall)

---

### **ROUND 3 - BIG WIN (Higher Risk) - Optional**

If you won Rounds 1 & 2, the gambler's eyes gleam: "Alright, high roller. Let's make this interesting. 6 coins, win 20 coins!"

- **Cost:** 6 coins
- **Prize:** 20 coins (net profit: +14 coins)
- **What you need:** Roll DEX + d20, need 14+

**Results:**
- **14+:** YOU WIN! +20 coins! **Total profit from all 3 rounds: +27 coins!**
  - The gambler laughs and shakes your hand: "THREE in a row! You've got the gift! I've bet on you three heroes. Word travels fast—three paths, big quest. The Void Tyrant doesn't think you can win. He's arrogant. That's his weakness. Make me rich, and I'll be cheering for you!"

- **Fail:** Lose 6 coins, but keep previous winnings (net total: +7 coins overall from all rounds)

---

### **ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES (Instead of Playing)**

**WALK AWAY (0 coins):**
- No risk, no reward. The gambler shrugs and continues his game.

**STUDY THE PATTERN FIRST (INT check, no cost):**
- Roll INT + d20, need 12+
- **Success:** You notice his tells! Gain advantage (roll twice, take higher) on your first game
- **Failure:** Too fast to figure out

**NEGOTIATE BETTER ODDS (CHA check, no cost):**
- Roll CHA + d20, need 14+
- **Success:** "Alright, I like you. First round only costs 1 coin instead of 2!"
- **Failure:** "The odds are what they are, friend."

---

**DM NOTE:** After the gambling (win or lose), the gambler says:

"I've bet on you three. Word travels fast—three heroes, three paths, big quest. The Void Tyrant doesn't think you can win. He's arrogant. That's his weakness. Make me rich!"

## POTION SELLER ENCOUNTER (Revised - 3-Tier Pricing)

```
# SPENDING ENCOUNTER: POTION SELLER
====================================================================================================
====================================================================================================
### THE POTION SELLER'S WAGON
**Scene Description:**
You smell the wagon before you see it—a heady mix of herbs, flowers, and strange chemical scents. A colorful wagon sits parked, covered in hanging bottles and vials. Wind chimes made of glass phials tinkle musically.

An elderly figure emerges, surprisingly spry, with sharp eyes. Gnarled hands sort through bottles with practiced ease.

**SPENDING ENCOUNTER: THE POTION SELLER'S WAGON**
(After Cameo 8 - Players likely have 30-50 coins)

---

**DM NARRATION:**
The potion seller looks you over with keen eyes.

**Potion Seller:** "Ah, another traveler seeking an edge. Smart. Magic and steel are fine, but potions? Potions can turn the tide when all else fails. I have potions for every need and every budget. Or..." *The seller grins mischievously,* "...if you can identify rare ingredients, I might trade services for knowledge."

---

### **TIER 1 - BASIC POTIONS (3-5 coins)**

---

### **FREE OPTION - PROVE YOUR KNOWLEDGE (Risky!)**

**"IDENTIFY THESE INGREDIENTS" (No coins, but risky)**

The potion seller holds up three mysterious ingredients: "If you can correctly identify all three of these rare components, I'll brew you a potion for free. But if you fail... well, I don't have time for amateurs. No sales for you today."

**Roll INT or WIS + d20**
- **18+ or Natural 20:** Perfect identification! The seller is impressed!
  - "You DO know your alchemy! Impressive!"
  - **REWARD:** Choose any TIER 1 or TIER 2 potion FOR FREE + "The trials ahead will test more than your body—they'll test your heart, mind, and spirit. Stay strong."

- **10-17:** You identify 1 or 2 correctly. The seller nods: "Not bad, but not enough for free services. My prices stand, but you're welcome to purchase."

- **1-9:** You misidentify all three! The seller frowns: "You know nothing of alchemy. I can't waste time with amateurs. Good day!" **(LOSE THE CHANCE TO BUY ANYTHING - encounter over)**

---

**DM NOTE:** After transaction, the potion seller says:

"The trials ahead will test more than your body—they'll test your heart, mind, and spirit. Your leader is counting on you. Stay strong."

  - For formal REWARD sections: `- +5 coins earned` (DONE for 5 encounters)
  - For narrative encounters: Add `[+5 COINS EARNED]` or similar notation after the artifact mention

## TEMPLATES FOR NARRATIVE ENCOUNTERS:

```
Lena leaves the Redemption Garden with the Chains of Freedom (Artifact 4/12) and a fourth signature (Signature 4/12).
